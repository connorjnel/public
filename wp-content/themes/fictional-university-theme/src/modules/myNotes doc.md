# MyNotes Documentation

This is a JavaScript class called MyNotes. It is designed to provide functionality for managing notes in a web application.

The class depends on the jQuery library and it imports the library at the top of the code with import $ from 'jquery';.

The constructor method of the MyNotes class calls the events method, which sets up event listeners on various elements on the page.

The events method sets up event listeners for three buttons:

Delete Note button with class delete-note
Edit Note button with class edit-note
Update Note button with class update-note

The deleteNote method is called when the user clicks the Delete Note button. It sends an AJAX request to the server to delete the corresponding note with a DELETE request. It sets a header called X-WP-Nonce to a value stored in a global object called universityData to ensure that only authenticated users can delete notes. If the AJAX request is successful, it slides up the corresponding note and logs a success message to the console. If the AJAX request fails, it logs an error message to the console.

The updateNote method is called when the user clicks the Update Note button. It sends an AJAX request to the server to update the corresponding note with a POST request. It sets a header called X-WP-Nonce to a value stored in the universityData object to ensure that only authenticated users can update notes. It sends data with the updated note title and content to the server. If the AJAX request is successful, it makes the corresponding note read-only and logs a success message to the console. If the AJAX request fails, it logs an error message to the console.

The editNote method is called when the user clicks the Edit Note button. It toggles the state of the corresponding note between editable and read-only. If the note is in the editable state, it makes the note read-only. If the note is in the read-only state, it makes the note editable.

The makeNoteEditable method is called when the note is in the read-only state and the user clicks the Edit Note button. It changes the Edit Note button text to "Cancel", makes the title and body fields editable and adds a class to the fields. It also shows the Update Note button and sets the state of the note to "editable".

The makeNoteReadOnly method is called when the note is in the editable state and the user clicks the Edit Note button. It changes the Edit Note button text to "Edit", makes the title and body fields read-only and removes the class from the fields. It also hides the Update Note button and sets the state of the note to "cancel".

Finally, the MyNotes class is exported as the default export of the module, so that other modules can import it and use its functionality.
